When a message is sent in a guild channel or DM, the bot will check that it's
a DM message and move through the script.
First it splits the message content into sections to easily pull out the
"send" command, the "channel-name", and the "users-message"

Using the "channel-name" it will check if the user is in a mutal guild with the bot,
then it will iterate through all mutual guilds' channels to find a channel that matches
the user inputted "channel-name" once it does, it will find the ID for that channel.

If it fails, it will alert the user that no channels match the name provided.
If successful, it will generate a preview for the user and send a DM of this preview
showing intended channel, and the user's message contents to be sent.

Finally, it lets the user confirm or cancel the message
